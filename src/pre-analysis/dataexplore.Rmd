```{r setup and require library, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr) #for counting by brand using groupby
```

```{r read data}
df <- read.csv("../../data/df_scanner.csv")
```

Count by category
```{r check category}
print(table(df$category))
```

Count by brand
```{r print brand result}
print(df %>% group_by(category) %>%
     summarise(count = n_distinct(brand)))
```

We will first do analysis from cereals, cookies and toilet tissue due to small number of brand and moderate number of purchases in each categories.
