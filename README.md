# Discounthreshold

## Research Question:
1) Is price elasticity and discount (promotional price) elasticity the same?
	Why? CB experiments show that the consumers process price and discount differently. Yet, it is unclear in term of generalizability.
2) Is the discount perception the same across categories/brands format and channels?
	Why? It is well established that there are differences in price perception across categories, brands, formats, and channel. Hence, I expect this to be the same for how consumers perceive the discount as well. Hence there are moderating roles of categories, brand, and channel (format?) on (1) types of benchmark (historical or competitive) (2) size of thresholds for gains and losses
3) Is it possible to draw discount threshold (in addition to price threshold)? 

What about assortment? [This could be called line length (see Datta et al. 2019)
